### Know your client & business
Your first step in the logo design process is to understand what the business is & what the business goals are. It is also known as the **Client Discovery Phase**. A logo is only as good as its representation of a business, so it will not be effective unless you first know what kind of impression the brand is aiming for.

> **Logos are one of your strongest vehicles for branding.**

Asking the right questions to the client is a necessary step. So, at the end of this step, you can start brainstorming to process the information which you have obtained by asking the necessary questions into keywords and phrases.

### Take a dive into Industry
Every company has to contend with the standards of their industry, even if they are doing everything to stand out. So the next step in the logo design process is to research what kind of logos competitors and industry leaders have. This is referred to as the **Industry Discovery Phase**.

From other logos in your industry, you can conclude on some solid pieces of information like,
- What logo techniques work for your industry, i.e., brand colors or particular shapes
- What logo techniques are ignored, which might inspire ways to stand out.
- What kind of customers dominates your industry?

### The logo usage in different scenarios
Just like the brand strategy, the physical or digital space the logo will occupy should also inform your design choices. Research where the logo will be used, this is known as the **Application Discovery Phase**.

For example, if you want your logo on large billboards, you can design more detailed, larger-scale logos. If it’s going to be situated in the corner of a mobile app, you should opt for simplicity and smaller scales. If social media will play a heavy role, the logo should sit comfortably in both circular and square avatars and be adaptable to larger cover images. If you want to stand out in video or digital platforms, you can even have an animated logo. So, the designer will have to plan for all of these scenarios.

These are some common use cases for a logo design:
- Website Icons
- Signs & Banners
- Product Packaging
- Advertisements
- Social media profiles & Banners
- Business Cards
- Company Letterheads
- Email marketing campaigns
- Marketing swag (pens, shirts, mugs, etc.)

> **Considering the popularity of responsive logos, you do not have to limit yourself to one standard design. Plus, you always have the best logo for any situation.**

### Let's vectorize
By now, you should have lots of logo sketches as well as a better sense of what you want the final logo to look like. Of those sketches, take around 3 of your best ones and recreate them in your design software. This is where your final logo really starts taking shape. In your digital draft, you can experiment with logo colors as well as typography.

Once you have a solid draft, go the extra mile to create a presentation to showcase your logo. This involves presenting the flat logo along with any variations, an overlay with brand imagery, and mockups of the logo out in the real world. 

> **The goal is to communicate your vision of the brand with a persuasive, knockout logo presentation.**
