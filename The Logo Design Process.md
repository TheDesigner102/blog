### Know your client & business
Your first step in the logo design process is to understand what the business is & what the business goals are. It is also known as the **Client Discovery Phase**. A logo is only as good as its representation of a business, so it will not be effective unless you first know what kind of impression the brand is aiming for.

> **Logos are one of your strongest vehicles for branding.**

Asking the right questions to the client is a necessary step. So, at the end of this step, you can start brainstorming to process the information which you have obtained by asking the necessary questions into keywords and phrases.

### Take a dive into Industry
Every company has to contend with the standards of their industry, even if they are doing everything to stand out. So the next step in the logo design process is to research what kind of logos competitors and industry leaders have. This is referred to as the **Industry Discovery Phase**.

From other logos in your industry, you can conclude on some solid pieces of information like,
- What logo techniques work for your industry, i.e., brand colors or particular shapes
- What logo techniques are ignored, which might inspire ways to stand out.
- What kind of customers dominates your industry?

### The logo usage in different scenarios
Just like the brand strategy, the physical or digital space the logo will occupy should also inform your design choices. Research where the logo will be used, this is known as the **Application Discovery Phase**.

For example, if you want your logo on large billboards, you can design more detailed, larger-scale logos. If it’s going to be situated in the corner of a mobile app, you should opt for simplicity and smaller scales. If social media will play a heavy role, the logo should sit comfortably in both circular and square avatars and be adaptable to larger cover images. If you want to stand out in video or digital platforms, you can even have an animated logo. So, the designer will have to plan for all of these scenarios.

These are some common use cases for a logo design:
- Website Icons
- Signs & Banners
- Product Packaging
- Advertisements
- Social media profiles & Banners
- Business Cards
- Company Letterheads
- Email marketing campaigns
- Marketing swag (pens, shirts, mugs, etc.)

> **Considering the popularity of responsive logos, you do not have to limit yourself to one standard design. Plus, you always have the best logo for any situation.**

### Sketching is fun!
If you already have some logo ideas, you might be tempted to jump ahead into logo design software. But before you start proceeding to your final design, take some time to sketch plenty of ideas.

> **Sketching is cheap, easy, and fast, but most importantly, it is an effective brainstorming tool.**

Once you have settled on your preferred concept, try sketching some variations on it, adding or removing elements, changing minor details, and beginning typography explorations.

### Let's vectorize
By now, you should have lots of logo sketches as well as a better sense of what you want the final logo to look like. Of those sketches, take around 3 of your best ones and recreate them in your design software. This is where your final logo really starts taking shape. In your digital draft, you can experiment with logo colors as well as typography.

Once you have a solid draft, go the extra mile to create a presentation to showcase your logo. This involves presenting the flat logo along with any variations, an overlay with brand imagery, and mockups of the logo out in the real world. 

> **The goal is to communicate your vision of the brand with a persuasive, knockout logo presentation.**

### Logo design & feedback
**Here is something you do not need to be a designer to appreciate: Everyone's a critic!**

No matter how perfect you think your logo design is, chances are someone, somewhere, is going to request changes. A fresh set of eyes on the final product can reveal some room for improvement you had not noticed before.

Getting feedback on your design is the easy part. The real challenge lies in interpreting and acting on client feedback. Ask follow-up questions and use your best judgment to decide what feedback is most valuable.

### Prepare & deliver
With your logo finalized, it is time to deliver your final files! You should determine what design files your client needs at the start of the process. 

In general, it is best to include:
- Layered source vector files, such as AI
- Layered EPS/PDF files (for clients using different vector programs)
- High-resolution raster files for web, including PNGs with transparent backgrounds

**Be sure to include basic variations of the logo, such as full color, black, white, and monochrome.**

You could say that great design takes talent, but you can never know for sure what that means or whether you have it. What you can say for sure is that great logos do not happen by accident. They are the result of critical thinking, interrogating, collaborating, exploring, failing, and starting again. Each detail of your logo like colors, fonts, sizes, shapes, and other elements can affect the kind of impression it makes on customers.

> **A smart logo design brings brands to life.**
