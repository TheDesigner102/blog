### Know your client & business
Your first step in the logo design process is to understand what the business is & what the business goals are. It is also known as the **Client Discovery Phase**. A logo is only as good as its representation of a business, so it will not be effective unless you first know what kind of impression the brand is aiming for.

> **Logos are one of your strongest vehicles for branding.**

Asking the right questions to the client is a necessary step. So, at the end of this step, you can start brainstorming to process the information which you have obtained by asking the necessary questions into keywords and phrases.

### Take a dive into Industry
Every company has to contend with the standards of their industry, even if they are doing everything to stand out. So the next step in the logo design process is to research what kind of logos competitors and industry leaders have. This is referred to as the **Industry Discovery Phase**.

From other logos in your industry, you can conclude on some solid pieces of information like,
- What logo techniques work for your industry, i.e., brand colors or particular shapes
- What logo techniques are ignored, which might inspire ways to stand out.
- What kind of customers dominates your industry?
